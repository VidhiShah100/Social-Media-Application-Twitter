This project involves creating a Social Media Platform (similar to Twitter) using SpringBoot to develop REST APIs. It utilizes an H2 database for storing data and adheres to API specifications detailed in a Postman Collection. The application includes functionalities such as user authentication (login and signup), user details retrieval, posting and managing posts (creation, retrieval, editing, deletion), commenting on posts (creation, retrieval, editing, deletion), and fetching details of all users. Each API endpoint is meticulously designed to handle errors and return JSON responses, ensuring robustness and usability.
